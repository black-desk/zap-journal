# zap-journal

This is a extension of zap
which implement systemd-journal `zapcore.Encoder` and `zapcore.WriteSyncer`.

Check ./example/example.go for usage.

## Note

1. The default logger setup produce a named logger with the executable file name
   get from `os.Executable()`.
   This behavior is different from zap.

2. The key passed to zap will be convert to **UPPERCASE.
   As journald seems refuse to record lowercase fields.

3. `journalctl` will not show any custom fields by default.
   And it not support any format customization.
   But it has an option to output log as json stream.
   If you need something to format that json stream into a human readable log,
   check [journalfmt][1].
